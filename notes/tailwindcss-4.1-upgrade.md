# Tailwind CSS 4.1 Upgrade Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the upgrade of the project to Tailwind CSS 4.1, including all changes made and verification steps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies Updated
- Updated `package.json` to use `"tailwindcss": "^4.1.0"` in devDependencies
- Kept existing Next.js version compatible with Tailwind 4.1

### 2. PostCSS Configuration
- Updated `postcss.config.mjs` to use the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- Removed the old `tailwindcss` plugin configuration

### 3. Global CSS File
- Updated `src/app/globals.css` to use `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of `@tailwind` directives
- Maintained existing custom theme colors and dark mode configurations
- Kept `@layer base` and `@layer components` directives for custom styling

## Key Improvements in Tailwind CSS 4.1

### 1. CSS-First Configuration
- Tailwind 4.1 introduces a CSS-first configuration approach
- The `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax replaces the need for a separate `tailwind.config.js` file in many cases
- Configuration can be done directly in CSS files

### 2. Improved Performance
- Faster build times with the new PostCSS plugin
- Better tree-shaking and smaller CSS output
- Enhanced JIT compiler performance

### 3. Enhanced Features
- Better support for modern CSS features
- Improved dark mode handling
- Enhanced custom property support

## Verification Steps

### 1. Dependency Check
```bash
pnpm list tailwindcss
```

### 2. Build Process
- Verified that the development server starts without errors
- Confirmed that CSS is properly generated and applied
- Tested responsive design features

### 3. Functionality Testing
- Created a test page at `/test-tailwind-4.1` to verify:
  - Custom color classes work correctly
  - Responsive design utilities function
  - Dark mode classes are applied
  - @apply directives work in component CSS

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Updated dependencies
2. `postcss.config.mjs` - Updated PostCSS plugin configuration
3. `src/app/globals.css` - Updated import syntax and maintained custom styles

## Migration Notes
