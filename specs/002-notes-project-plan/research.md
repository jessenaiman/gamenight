# Research: Project Plan Template for AI Agent

## Decision: No Additional Research Required

### Rationale:
The feature specification for "Project Plan Template for AI Agent" is clear and complete. All technical details are already well-defined in the existing project plan document at `notes/project-plan.md`. There are no ambiguous areas that require further research or clarification.

### Alternatives Considered:
1. Conduct research on AI agent documentation best practices
2. Research template structures for developer onboarding
3. Investigate existing documentation frameworks

However, since the feature specification is already complete and the existing project plan provides sufficient context, no additional research is needed.

## Technical Findings:

### Project Context
The Game Night Central project already has a comprehensive project plan that serves as a reference guide for the AI agent. The plan includes:

1. Tech stack information (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4.1, Shadcn UI, React)
2. File structure documentation
3. Learning strategy for the AI agent
4. Knowledge management practices using markdown
5. Database and authentication plan
6. Next steps for AI agent operations

### Documentation Structure
The existing project plan follows a well-organized structure with:
- Clear table of contents for navigation
- Tech stack and dependencies documentation
- File tree structure visualization
- Learning strategy guidelines
- Knowledge management practices
- Database and authentication planning
- Next steps for AI agent operations

### AI Agent Operations
The project plan already defines how the AI agent should operate:
- Load README.md and project plan on startup
- Search for existing notes or code before any task
- Write markdown notes after learning new concepts
- Verify read-only status of files before writing

## Conclusion:
No additional research is required as the feature specification is complete and the existing project plan provides all necessary context for implementing the documentation template for AI agent operations.
