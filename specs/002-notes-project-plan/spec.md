# Feature Specification: Project Plan Template for AI Agent

**Feature Branch**: `002-notes-project-plan`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "notes/project-plan.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
The AI agent needs a comprehensive reference guide to understand the project context, navigate files, manage knowledge, and execute tasks efficiently without requiring real-time scanning. This document serves as a template that can be used for project planning and as a reference for the AI agent's operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI agent is starting to work on the project, **When** it reads the project plan, **Then** it should understand the tech stack, file structure, and operational guidelines.
2. **Given** a developer wants to understand the project, **When** they read the project plan, **Then** they should have a clear understanding of the project's organization and key components.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the project structure changes significantly?
- How does the system handle updates to the project plan template?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a template for project planning that includes sections for tech stack, file structure, and operational guidelines
- **FR-002**: System MUST include guidance on how the AI agent should operate within the project
- **FR-003**: System MUST document the learning strategy for the AI agent
- **FR-004**: System MUST specify knowledge management practices using markdown
- **FR-005**: System MUST outline the database and authentication plan
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide next steps for the AI agent when starting work
- **FR-007**: System MUST include information about read-only directories and components

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project Plan Template**: A markdown document that serves as a reference guide for the AI agent with sections for tech stack, file structure, learning strategy, knowledge management, database plan, and next steps
- **AI Agent**: An automated system that uses the project plan to understand the project context and execute tasks
- **Tech Stack**: The collection of technologies used in the project including Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and React
- **Knowledge Management**: The system for storing and retrieving information using markdown notes
