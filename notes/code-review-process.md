Based on my analysis of your Codacy setup, here's the correct workflow to integrate Codacy with pull requests and issues:

## Current Setup Status ✅

Your repository is already properly set up with Codacy:
- **Repository**: Added and being followed
- **Coding Standard**: `nextjs-shadcn` 
- **Tools Enabled**: ESLint, Trivy, Semgrep, Markdownlint, Stylelint, PMD, Lizard
- **Gate Policy**: Codacy Gate Policy configured
- **Current Issues**: 114 total (mostly ESLint warnings, some security vulnerabilities)

## Complete Integration Workflow

### 1. **GitHub Integration Setup** (if not already done)
Ensure Codacy has access to your GitHub repository:
- Go to [Codacy Settings](https://app.codacy.com/gh/organizations/jessenaiman/repositories)
- Verify the repository shows "Added" status
- Check that the GitHub app has the necessary permissions

### 2. **Pull Request Integration**
Codacy automatically provides:
- **Status Checks**: Shows pass/fail status on PRs
- **PR Comments**: Detailed issue breakdown with suggestions
- **Coverage Reports**: Test coverage diff in PRs
- **Gate Policy**: Can block merges if quality thresholds aren't met

### 3. **Issue Management Workflow**

**For New Pull Requests:**
1. **Automatic Analysis**: Codacy analyzes the PR diff immediately
2. **Status Updates**: Updates GitHub status checks (pending → success/failure)
3. **PR Comments**: Posts detailed issue summary with:
   - New issues introduced
   - Fixed issues
   - Code quality metrics
   - Security vulnerabilities

**For Issues:**
- **Issue Creation**: Codacy can create GitHub issues for critical findings
- **Issue Linking**: Links Codacy issues to GitHub issues
- **Auto-assignment**: Can assign issues based on file ownership

### 4. **Quality Gates Configuration**
Your repository has a "Codacy Gate Policy" which can:
- **Block Merges**: Prevent merging PRs that don't meet quality standards
- **Require Reviews**: For PRs with high issue counts
- **Coverage Requirements**: Enforce minimum test coverage

### 5. **Development Workflow**

**Before Pushing Code:**
```bash
# Run local analysis (optional, for development)
codacy-cli analyze
```

**After Creating PR:**
1. Codacy automatically analyzes the PR
2. Check the PR for Codacy status checks
3. Review Codacy comments and fix issues
4. Address any gate policy violations

**For Critical Issues:**
- Security vulnerabilities (High/Critical priority)
- Code complexity issues
- Major linting violations

### 6. **Configuration Files**
Consider adding these to your repository:
- `.codacy.yml` - Custom Codacy configuration
- `.codacyrc` - Tool-specific configurations
- `.markdownlint.json` - Markdown linting rules

### 7. **Monitoring & Maintenance**
- **Dashboard**: Monitor at https://app.codacy.com/gh/jessenaiman/gamenight
- **Badges**: Already configured for grade and coverage
- **Webhooks**: Automatic updates on commits/PRs
- **Notifications**: Email alerts for policy violations

## Current Issues to Address
Your repository has 114 issues that should be addressed:
- **Security**: 3 Next.js CVEs requiring updates
- **Code Quality**: Multiple ESLint warnings (unused variables, type issues)
- **Documentation**: Markdown formatting issues

The integration is working correctly - Codacy will automatically analyze all future PRs and provide quality feedback. The gate policy ensures code quality standards are maintained before merges.
