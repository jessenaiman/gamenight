# Quick Start Guide: Project Plan Template for AI Agent

## Overview
This quick start guide provides a brief overview of how to use the Project Plan Template for AI Agent operations. The template serves as a reference guide for the AI agent to understand the project context, navigate files, manage knowledge, and execute tasks efficiently.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the project repository
- Basic understanding of markdown formatting
- Familiarity with the project's tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, etc.)

## Quick Start Steps

### 1. Understanding the Project Context
- Read the project plan document at `notes/project-plan.md`
- Review the tech stack information
- Understand the file structure and organization

### 2. Navigating Files
- Use the table of contents to locate relevant sections
- Refer to the file tree structure for directory navigation
- Identify read-only directories (e.g., `src/components/ui/`)

### 3. Managing Knowledge
- Create new markdown notes in the `notes/` directory
- Use the filename pattern: `notes/<topic>.md`
- Search for existing knowledge before creating new notes
- Update the table of contents when adding significant topics

### 4. Executing Tasks
- Load `README.md` and the project plan on startup
- Search for existing notes or code before any task
- Write markdown notes after learning new concepts
- Always verify read-only status before attempting to write files

### 5. Learning Strategy
- Follow the defined learning process:
  1. Create a markdown note for new topics
  2. Search for existing knowledge
  3. Read table of contents for relevant sections
  4. Update TOC when adding new topics
- Avoid duplicating existing knowledge

## Key Commands
- `search "<keyword>"` - Find content across files
- `read <file-path>` - Read file contents
- `write <file-path>` - Modify or create files
- `list <directory>` - List directory contents

## Best Practices
- Always search before writing
- Follow the established documentation structure
- Keep notes concise and focused
- Update the table of contents regularly
- Respect read-only directories

## Next Steps
1. Review the complete project plan at `notes/project-plan.md`
2. Explore the file structure
3. Practice creating and updating notes
4. Familiarize yourself with AI agent operations

## Troubleshooting
- If content seems missing, check if it's in a different section
- Verify file paths are correct
- Ensure you have the latest version of the project plan
- Check for updates to the documentation structure
